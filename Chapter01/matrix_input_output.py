Matrix Input Output
-------------------

This file contains some utility functions for reading from standard input. These cover single integers,
integer arrays and matrices. Also implemented is *Freivalds test* (1979) to determine, probabilistically
whether the equality :math:`AB = C` holds for :math:`n*n` matrices :math:`A, B, C` .
